The goal of this project is to record my "project euler" problem solutions. You can view all the existing problems on http://projecteuler.net/problems

NOTE:
I use Python as the primary programming language, some C/C++/golang would also be used.
Project euler problems have a one minute rule: that means your solution must be fast enough to get the correct answer under 1 minute. (that's quite generous though :D) Try to crack these problems as fast as you can.
